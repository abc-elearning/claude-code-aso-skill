# Task: Update ASO scorer with technical performance and visual optimization scoring

## Description
Reweight `aso_scorer.py` scoring categories to include technical performance (15%) and visual optimization (5%). Add methods for scoring app technical health (crash rate, ANR rate, battery impact from Android Vitals) and visual optimization (screenshot caption usage, CPP count). Apply platform-specific weighting (Google weights technical performance higher than Apple).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Score weights updated: metadata (20%), ratings (20%), keywords (20%), conversion (20%), technical (15%), visual (5%)
- [ ] `score_technical_performance(crash_rate, anr_rate, battery_impact)` method added
- [ ] `score_visual_optimization(has_captions, cpp_count, has_video)` method added
- [ ] Platform-specific weighting: Google technical=20% visual=5%, Apple technical=10% visual=10%
- [ ] All weights sum to 100 (assertion check)
- [ ] Technical scoring uses benchmarks: crash <1% (good), ANR <0.5% (good), battery impact <5% (good)
- [ ] Visual scoring: has_captions (3pts), cpp_count>0 (1pt), has_video (1pt) = 5pts max
- [ ] Recommendations updated to include technical improvement suggestions
- [ ] Backward compatible: existing `calculate_overall_score()` still works with old parameters (technical/visual default to neutral)

## Technical Details
- Files affected:
  - `app-store-optimization/aso_scorer.py` (extend ASOScorer class)
  - `.claude/skills/aso/aso_scorer.py` (sync)
- Current WEIGHTS dict: `{'metadata_quality': 25, 'ratings_reviews': 25, 'keyword_performance': 25, 'conversion_metrics': 25}`
- New WEIGHTS dict (default): `{'metadata_quality': 20, 'ratings_reviews': 20, 'keyword_performance': 20, 'conversion_metrics': 20, 'technical_performance': 15, 'visual_optimization': 5}`
- Platform-specific WEIGHTS:
  - GOOGLE_WEIGHTS: technical=20, visual=5, metadata=20, ratings=20, keywords=20, conversion=15
  - APPLE_WEIGHTS: technical=10, visual=10, metadata=20, ratings=20, keywords=20, conversion=20
- Technical scoring inputs are user-provided (Android Vitals data for Google, Apple doesn't expose equivalent)
- Default to neutral score (50/100) when technical data not provided

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 6 must be complete (visual scoring references CPP and screenshot caption usage)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8-16
- Parallel: false (depends on Task 6)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `python3 aso_scorer.py` passes syntax check
- [ ] All weight configurations sum to 100
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing `calculate_overall_score()` calls
- [ ] Platform-specific scoring produces different results for Google vs Apple
- [ ] Both skill copies synced
- [ ] Zero external dependencies maintained
