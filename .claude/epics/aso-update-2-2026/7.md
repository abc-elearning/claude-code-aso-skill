# Task: Update launch checklist with 2026 compliance deadlines

## Description
Extend `launch_checklist.py` with 6 new compliance items for 2026 platform requirements. Add dynamic deadline comparison that warns users when their launch date is near or past a compliance deadline. Each compliance item includes specific date, required action, and consequences of non-compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 6 new compliance items added:
  1. Apple age rating restructuring (5 categories) - Deadline: January 31, 2026
  2. Google battery optimization compliance - Deadline: March 1, 2026
  3. Apple promo code discontinuation - Deadline: March 26, 2026
  4. Apple SDK requirements (iOS 26 SDK) - Deadline: April 28, 2026
  5. Google Age Signals API restrictions - Deadline: January 1, 2026
  6. Google US billing policy changes - Deadline: January 28, 2026
- [ ] Each item has: deadline date, required action, consequence of non-compliance, verification steps
- [ ] `check_compliance_deadlines(launch_date)` method compares deadlines against user's launch date
- [ ] Warnings generated for deadlines within 30 days of launch date
- [ ] Errors generated for deadlines already passed
- [ ] Dynamic output: "⚠️ Apple SDK requirement deadline (Apr 28, 2026) is 14 days after your launch date"
- [ ] Existing 47-item checklist preserved and extended (now 53 items)

## Technical Details
- Files affected:
  - `app-store-optimization/launch_checklist.py` (739 lines, extend LaunchChecklist class)
  - `.claude/skills/aso/launch_checklist.py` (sync)
- Add `COMPLIANCE_DEADLINES_2026` list of dicts with: name, platform, deadline (ISO date string), action, consequence
- Add `check_compliance_deadlines(launch_date_str)` method:
  1. Parse launch_date from ISO string using `datetime.fromisoformat()`
  2. Compare each deadline against launch_date
  3. Categorize: passed (error), within 30 days (warning), future (info)
  4. Return list of compliance status dicts
- Use `datetime` module (standard library, already likely imported)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2 must be complete (agent definitions reference updated compliance)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Tasks 3 and 5 after Task 2)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `python3 launch_checklist.py` passes syntax check
- [ ] All 6 compliance items have specific dates (no placeholders)
- [ ] Deadline comparison produces correct warnings/errors
- [ ] Existing 47-item checklist still functions correctly
- [ ] Both skill copies synced
- [ ] Zero external dependencies maintained
