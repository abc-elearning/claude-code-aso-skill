# Task: Sync skill copies, end-to-end testing, and documentation update

## Description
Final integration task. Sync both skill copies (app-store-optimization/ ↔ .claude/skills/aso/), run full end-to-end testing with FitFlow example app, update all documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md) with v1.1 changes, and update the FitFlow example outputs to demonstrate new features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `diff -r app-store-optimization/ .claude/skills/aso/` shows no differences (excluding AGENT-INTEGRATION.md)
- [ ] `/aso-full-audit FitFlow` produces outputs with new sections:
  - Screenshot caption recommendations in metadata output
  - CPP strategy section in metadata output
  - Review analysis from fetched reviews in research output
  - Semantic keyword clusters in keyword output
  - Technical performance score in ASO health score
  - 2026 compliance items in pre-launch checklist
  - Region used in all analysis
- [ ] FitFlow example updated in `outputs/FitFlow-example/` with new sections
- [ ] README.md updated:
  - Version bumped to 1.1.0
  - New features listed (region targeting, review analysis, semantic keywords, screenshot captions, CPP strategy, technical scoring, 2026 compliance)
  - Updated example outputs
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with v1.1 architecture changes
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with v1.1 entry
- [ ] `app-store-optimization.zip` regenerated with updated modules
- [ ] All Python modules pass syntax check: `python3 *.py`

## Technical Details
- Sync command: `cp -r app-store-optimization/*.py .claude/skills/aso/ && cp -r app-store-optimization/lib/* .claude/skills/aso/lib/`
- Diff check: `diff -r --exclude='*.md' --exclude='sample*' --exclude='expected*' app-store-optimization/ .claude/skills/aso/`
- ZIP regeneration: `cd .. && zip -r app-store-optimization.zip app-store-optimization/ -x "*.pyc" "__pycache__/*"`
- Documentation files:
  - `README.md` (622 lines)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (16KB)
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
  - `PROJECT-STATUS.md`

## Dependencies
- [ ] All tasks 3-7 must be complete (this is the integration gate)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-24
- Parallel: false (final integration task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Both skill copies identical (verified by diff)
- [ ] End-to-end test produces complete outputs with all new sections
- [ ] All documentation updated and consistent
- [ ] ZIP package regenerated
- [ ] Version bumped to 1.1.0 across all files
- [ ] FitFlow example demonstrates all new features
- [ ] All Python modules pass syntax check
- [ ] No broken links in documentation
