# Task: Update agent definitions and commands with 2026 ASO knowledge and region targeting

## Description
Update all 4 ASO agent definitions (aso-master, aso-research, aso-optimizer, aso-strategist) with 25 platform changes from Nov 2025 to Feb 2026. Add region/market targeting prompt to all 4 slash commands. Update aso-master to collect region at orchestration start and pass to all agent invocations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] aso-master.md updated with 2026 synthesis knowledge, region collection, region pass-through
- [ ] aso-research.md updated with review fetching step, region-aware iTunes API calls, competitor review mining
- [ ] aso-optimizer.md updated with screenshot caption section, CPP strategy section, semantic coherence guidance
- [ ] aso-strategist.md updated with 2026 compliance deadlines, technical performance recommendations
- [ ] All 4 slash commands (aso-full-audit, aso-optimize, aso-prelaunch, aso-competitor) include region prompt
- [ ] Default region is "us" if user doesn't specify
- [ ] All 25 platform changes documented in agent knowledge sections

## Technical Details
- Files affected:
  - `.claude/agents/aso/aso-master.md` (576 lines)
  - `.claude/agents/aso/aso-research.md` (670 lines)
  - `.claude/agents/aso/aso-optimizer.md` (821 lines)
  - `.claude/agents/aso/aso-strategist.md` (1114 lines)
  - `.claude/commands/aso/aso-full-audit.md` (203 lines)

  - `.claude/commands/aso/aso-prelaunch.md` (85 lines)
  - `.claude/commands/aso/aso-competitor.md` (107 lines)
- Key platform changes to incorporate:
  - Apple: Screenshot caption indexing, CPP expansion (35→70), CPP keyword assignment, AI-generated tags, Visual Intelligence, age rating restructuring, 100+ new analytics metrics, SDK requirements (Apr 2026)
  - Google: Battery optimization as ranking factor (Mar 2026), Android Vitals as primary signal, semantic coherence over keyword stuffing, reviews as direct ranking factor, hero content carousel
  - Industry: ASO as strategy (Phiture), semantic keyword clusters (AppTweak), intent-driven algorithms, connected decision-making (SplitMetrics)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None (this is the foundational task)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32
- Parallel: false (blocks all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 4 agent definitions updated with 2026 knowledge
- [ ] All 4 slash commands include region prompt
- [ ] Region parameter flows from command → master → specialist agents
- [ ] No broken markdown formatting in agent files
- [ ] Agent files remain self-contained (no external knowledge references)
