# Task: Add semantic keyword clustering to keyword analyzer

## Description
Extend `keyword_analyzer.py` with intent-based keyword clustering. Add predefined intent categories, a clustering method that groups keywords by semantic intent, natural language query generation for voice/AI search, and cluster-level scoring. This shifts the system from individual keyword targeting to the 2026 best practice of intent-based clusters.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `INTENT_CATEGORIES` dict added with 10+ categories (track, manage, plan, create, learn, find, compare, monitor, organize, share, etc.)
- [ ] `cluster_by_intent(keywords)` method groups keywords into intent themes
- [ ] `generate_natural_queries(cluster)` creates conversational query variants (e.g., "apps to help me track expenses")
- [ ] `score_cluster(cluster)` calculates combined cluster potential from individual keyword scores
- [ ] Keywords with overlapping words/stems grouped together
- [ ] Each cluster has: name, keywords, intent, natural_queries, combined_score
- [ ] Works with zero external dependencies (no NLTK, spaCy)
- [ ] Tested with 20+ sample keywords producing coherent clusters

## Technical Details
- Files affected:
  - `app-store-optimization/keyword_analyzer.py` (extend KeywordAnalyzer class)
  - `.claude/skills/aso/keyword_analyzer.py` (sync)
- Clustering approach (no ML required):
  1. Define intent category keywords (e.g., "track" → [track, monitor, log, record, measure])
  2. Match each user keyword against intent categories by word overlap
  3. Group keywords sharing the same primary intent
  4. Score clusters by summing/averaging individual keyword scores
- Natural query generation:
  - Template: "apps to help me {intent} {object}"
  - Template: "best {object} {intent_verb} app"
  - Template: "how to {intent} {object} on my phone"
- Use `re` module for word tokenization (already imported)
- Use `collections.Counter` for frequency analysis (already imported)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2 must be complete (agent definitions reference semantic clustering)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-24
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Task 3 and 7 after Task 2)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `python3 keyword_analyzer.py` passes syntax check
- [ ] Clustering produces coherent groups for test keywords (manual review >80%)
- [ ] Natural queries read naturally (not keyword-stuffed)
- [ ] Both skill copies synced
- [ ] Zero external dependencies maintained
