# Project Vision

## Long-Term Vision

Become the definitive open-source ASO toolkit for AI-powered app store optimization, enabling any developer to achieve professional-grade app store presence without expensive tools or specialized knowledge.

## Strategic Direction

### Current State (v1.0 - Production Ready)
- 4-agent system with orchestrated workflow
- iTunes Search API integration (free data)
- Copy-paste ready metadata generation
- Character-validated outputs for both platforms
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Near-Term Goals (v1.1)
- iTunes Review API integration for sentiment analysis
- Historical tracking database for keyword ranking trends
- Enhanced A/B test analytics with statistical significance
- Multi-language support (Spanish, German, French)

### Long-Term Goals (v2.0)
- Paid API integration (AppTweak, Sensor Tower) for exact search volumes
- Web dashboard for ongoing tracking and visualization
- Automated reporting with scheduled ASO health checks
- Team collaboration features for agency workflows

## Differentiators

1. **AI-First Approach** - Not a traditional SaaS tool; leverages Claude's language understanding for natural metadata generation
2. **Agent Architecture** - Coordinated specialists rather than monolithic tool
3. **Zero Cost** - Uses only free APIs and open-source components
4. **Developer-Native** - Integrates into Claude Code CLI workflow
5. **Dual Distribution** - Works as both CLI agent system and Claude Desktop skill

## Guiding Principles

- **Actionable over analytical** - Every output should be immediately usable
- **Specific over generic** - Real dates, real data, real recommendations
- **Compliant by default** - Character limits enforced automatically
- **Transparent limitations** - Clearly document when data is estimated vs exact
- **Progressive disclosure** - Quick commands for simple needs, full audit for comprehensive analysis
